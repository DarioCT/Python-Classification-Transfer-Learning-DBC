# Python-Classification-Transfer-Learning-DBC

The project aims to develop code that will accept any user-supplied image as input. If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed. If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.

Project Steps:
    Step 0: Import Datasets
    Step 1: Detect Humans
    Step 2: Detect Dogs
    Step 3: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)
    Step 4: Use a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
    Step 5: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
    Step 6: Write your Algorithm
    Step 7: Test Your Algorithm
